# Cuisine Classification Model for Restaurent Recommendation System

## Overview

This repository contains code and resources for classifying restaurants based on their cuisines using machine learning techniques. The goal is to accurately predict the cuisine type of a given restaurant based on its features.

## Dataset

- **Dataset Source**: [Insert dataset source link here]
- **Description**: The dataset includes information about various restaurants, such as location, menu items, ratings, and cuisine type.
- **Features**: [List the relevant features/columns in your dataset]

## Getting Started

1. **Prerequisites**:
   - Python 3.x
   - Required libraries (e.g., pandas, scikit-learn, matplotlib)

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Handle missing values: Impute or remove any missing data.
   - Encode categorical variables (e.g., one-hot encoding for cuisine type).

3. **Data Splitting**:
   - Split the dataset into training and testing sets (e.g., 80% training, 20% testing).

4. **Model Selection and Training**:
   - Choose a classification algorithm (e.g., logistic regression, random forest).
   - Train the model using the training data.

5. **Model Evaluation**:
   - Evaluate the model's performance using metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
   - Use the testing data to assess generalization.

6. **Cuisine-Specific Analysis**:
   - Calculate performance metrics for each cuisine category.
